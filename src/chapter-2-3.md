Stress is a common experience in the workplace, but it can be challenging to define and manage. In this chapter, we will explore what stress is and how it affects us. We will also provide exercises to help you assess your personal approach to stress.

While stress can be helpful in certain situations, chronic stress can have negative effects on our physical and mental health. It can lead to symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, anxiety, and depression.

Assessing Your Personal Approach to Stress
------------------------------------------

Everyone experiences stress differently, and it is important to understand your personal approach to stress in order to effectively manage it. Here are some exercises to help you assess your approach:

1. Identify your stressors: Make a list of the situations or experiences that cause you to feel stressed. This could include specific work tasks, interactions with colleagues, or personal life events.

2. Evaluate your stress response: How do you typically respond to stress? Do you tend to avoid stressful situations, or do you confront them head-on? Do you engage in healthy coping mechanisms such as exercise and relaxation techniques, or do you turn to unhealthy behaviors such as overeating or substance use?

3. Consider your mindset: How do you perceive stress? Do you see it as a challenge to overcome, or as a threat to your well-being? Do you view stress as temporary and manageable, or as a chronic and overwhelming problem?
